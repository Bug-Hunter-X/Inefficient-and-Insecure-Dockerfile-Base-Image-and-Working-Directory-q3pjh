# Dockerfile Bug: Inefficient and Insecure Base Image

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily avoidable, problem in Dockerfiles: using an unnecessarily large and outdated base image and missing a working directory. This leads to inefficient builds, larger image sizes, increased attack surface, and potential ambiguity.

## The Bug

The original `Dockerfile` uses `ubuntu:latest` as the base image. This is problematic for several reasons:

* **Size:** `ubuntu:latest` is a large image, leading to slow downloads and larger image sizes.
* **Security:**  `latest` tags can be updated unexpectedly, introducing potential security vulnerabilities.
* **Ambiguity:**  Lack of a `WORKDIR` instruction makes the `COPY` command's behavior unpredictable and potentially prone to errors.

## The Solution

The `Dockerfile_fixed` provides a more efficient and secure alternative: 

* It uses a smaller, more specific base image (e.g., `python:3.9-slim-buster`). This significantly reduces the image size.
* It explicitly sets a working directory (`WORKDIR /app`) to clarify the context for the following commands.
* It utilizes multi-stage builds, which further reduces the final image size.

This revised Dockerfile improves build speed, image size, and security.
